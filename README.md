## So what's this all about?
Basically replaces the Soundtrack from Ridge Racer 3D with some track & remixes from previous games including some songs from other franchises
and don't get me wrong i like Ridge racer 3D OST but i just did this simply because of fun. :)

(Also no i did not copy sleepylark's RR3D music mod.)
